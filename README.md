Govspeak a markup language derived from [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax "Markdown syntax"), developed by the [Government Digital Service](digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk) for use on [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk). As well as implementing Markdown, it contains additional elements that are usefulf or publishing official information. [govspeak-drupal](https://github.com/LambethCouncil/govspeak-drupal) implements Govspeak for [Drupal](http://drupal.org/). The implementation of Markdown is [John Gruber's php Markdown](http://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/).

# Installation 

- Clone this repository, or download the [zipped version](https://github.com/LambethCouncil/govspeak-drupal/archive/master.zip) and unzip it. 
- Place the govspeak-drupal directory in sites/all/modules directory of your Drupal installation.

_The folder should be renamed from 'govspeak-drupal' to 'govspeak'_  
_At Lambeth, we have put it in sites/all/modules/custom, so in our case, govspeak.module is here: sites/all/modules/custom/govspeak/govspeak.module_
- Enable the module in the admin section of your Drupal install.

**Note:** _The module comes with very basic css styles for demonstration purposes. You will almost certainly want to overwrite them._

Note that steps need an extra line break after the final step (ie. two full blank lines) or other markdown directly afterwards won't work. If you have a subhead after - add a line break after this.

## Abbreviations

Abbreviations can be defined at the end of the document, and any occurrences elswhere in the document will wrapped in an `<abbr>` tag. They are parsed in the order in which they are defined, so `PCSOs` should be defined before `PCSO`, for example.

    Special rules apply if you’re exporting a vehicle outside the EU.

    *[EU]:European Union

becomes

    <p>Special rules apply if you’re exporting a vehicle outside the <abbr title="European Union">EU</abbr>.</p>
